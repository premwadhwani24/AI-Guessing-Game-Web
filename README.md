🔮 AI Guessing Game
AI Guessing Game is an interactive and intelligent project where the computer tries to guess what the user is thinking by asking a series of yes or no questions. It’s a fun way to demonstrate the power of decision trees and learning-based AI.

🧠 How It Works
The game begins by asking the user to think of an object (like an animal, fruit, or everyday item).

The AI then asks a series of yes/no questions to narrow down the possibilities.

Based on the user’s responses, the AI follows a decision tree to make its best guess.

If the AI’s guess is wrong, the user can teach the AI by providing the correct answer and a new question that distinguishes it.

This new knowledge is saved, making the AI smarter over time.
